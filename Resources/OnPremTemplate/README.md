# Klacks On-Prem (Docker) — Quickstart

Run Klacks on your own Windows or Linux machine with Docker. Updates apply automatically.

## Requirements
- **A host with at least 8 GB RAM and 4 vCPU.** Klacks runs its retrieval models
  (embedder + reranker) locally inside `klacks-api`; both sessions stay resident and
  need a 3584M container limit. On a smaller host, see `KLACKS_API_MEMORY_LIMIT` in
  `.env.example` — it must always be lowered together with
  `KLACKS_API_IDLE_UNLOAD_MINUTES`.
- Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine + Compose plugin (Linux)
- Outbound internet to `ghcr.io` and `github.com` (for images + auto-update)
- Open ports 80 + 443 (configurable)

## Install
**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -ServerName klacks.example.com -Region de
```
**Linux:**
```bash
SERVER_NAME=klacks.example.com REGION=de ./install.sh
```

The installer generates secrets + a self-signed certificate, pins the latest released
version, starts the stack, and waits until it is healthy. On Windows, install into a folder
on a local drive (e.g. `C:\klacks`): the script maps that folder into the Docker Desktop VM
so the auto-updater can recreate containers with the right bind mounts. Installations made
with an older `install.ps1` must re-run the script once from a current bundle, otherwise
automatic updates break the API's bind mounts. `-Region`/`REGION` is optional
and pre-configures the country's locale, holidays, worktime limits, surcharges and
industry presets on first boot — see [`regions/README.md`](regions/README.md) for the
list of supported country codes.

## First login
`admin@test.com` / `P@ssw0rt1` — **change this password immediately** and set your
mail/SMTP settings in the admin UI.

## ERP order import drop point
Order XML files can be picked up automatically from a folder inside the `klacks-api`
container, without going through the UI. The folder is a named Docker volume
(`api-erp-import:/app/ErpImport`) so it survives container restarts and updates. Ask
Klacksy (`get_erp_drop_point_settings`) for the exact resolved path, or use the default:
```bash
docker exec klacks-api mkdir -p /app/ErpImport/erp/orders
docker cp order.xml klacks-api:/app/ErpImport/erp/orders/order.xml
```
The `mkdir -p` step is only needed once — the sub-folder does not exist until either this
command, an upload through the settings UI, or `check_erp_drop_point_folder_health`
creates it. The file is picked up at the next scheduled run (hourly by default; ask
Klacksy to trigger one immediately with `trigger_erp_import_run`) and ends up in the
`processed/` or `error/` sub-folder next to it.
